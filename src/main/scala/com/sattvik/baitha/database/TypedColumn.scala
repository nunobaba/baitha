/** A typed column is meant to be used with the `TypedCursorWrapper` in order
  * to provide easier access to the contents of a cursor.  Compare the
  * following two examples:
  *
  * {{{
  * // using standard cursor
  * val myInt = cursor.getInt(cursor.getColumnIndexOrThrow("foo"))
  *
  * // using typed column
  * val fooColumn = TypedColumn[Int]("foo")
  * val myInt = cursor.getOrThrow(fooColumn)
  * }}}
  *
  * @tparam A the type for the column.  Valid values include `Int`, `Long`,
  * `Short`, `Float`, `Double`, `String`, and `Array[Byte]`
